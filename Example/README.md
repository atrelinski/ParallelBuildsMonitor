# Example to test Parallel Builds Monitor

This solution provides a small set of projects used to exercise and validate the Parallel Builds Monitor Visual Studio extension. It is intentionally simple and contains projects with dependencies and some intentionally buggy code to produce meaningful build timelines and failures.

Quick start
1. Build and run the Parallel Builds Monitor Visual Studio extension from the parent folder, or install it from the Marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivson4.ParallelBuildsMonitor-18691
2. Open the solution (`Example.sln`) in Visual Studio 2026.
3. Open the Parallel Builds Monitor window by selecting `View -> Other Windows -> Parallel Builds Monitor` from the Visual Studio menu.
4. Build or Rebuild the solution to generate parallel build activity.
5. Observe the Gantt chart and build activity generated by the projects in this solution.

Notes
- Projects are intentionally simple and contain flaws - this is deliberate so the monitor shows realistic build behavior (parallel tasks, queued builds, and failures).
- These examples are provided solely to test the Parallel Builds Monitor extension and are not intended as production code.
